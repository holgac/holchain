This is my collection of small helper scripts. Ideally, $REPO/bin should be in $PATH.

Projects in node folder (should `cd node && npm start`, accessed through localhost:3000)

redirect:
  Under localhost:3000/redirect, used with chrome's search engine. I added basic search stuff for amazon, amazon primenow, some dictionaries etc. Good thing is, I can add an entry from chrome as well - I set chrome to easily register new keywords when I type "lca new_keyword https://www.example.com?q=$s". After this, whenever I type "new_keyword test", chrome is redirected to example.com?q=test.

localdb:
  I use it as a simple key/value storage with the script I have in $REPO/bin.
